> choco new [package-name] --version [version] --maintainer="Jacob Buysse"

This creates the directory with the package name, creates the nuspec file, and the tools directory with sample install scripts.

> cd [package-name]
> notepad [package-name].nuspec

Edit the nuspec file, fill in template values.  Save.

> cd [tools]
> del *.*

Delete all of the scripts and the readme.  Don't need them for self-contained executable that is "shimmed".

> copy [exe-full-path]

Copy the exe to the tools folder.

> cd ..
> choco pack

Creates package (nupkg file with correct version, etc.)

> choco install [package-name] -source '[full-package-dir]' -f

Tests installation of the package.  This will automatically "shim" the contained exe.

> cd [wherever]
> [your-installed-exe-name]

Tests that the installation worked and that you can run your application from anywhere.

> choco uninstall [package-name]

Removes your test installation of the package.

> choco apikey -k [your-api-key] -source https://chocolatey.org/

Sets your apikey (you only need to do this once as far as I know) so you can push to the main feed.

> cd [full-package-dir]
> choco push .\[package-name].[version].nupkg -s https://chocolatey.org/

Pushes your package to chocolatey.  This is not immediately available in the feed but instead is waiting moderators to review it.
